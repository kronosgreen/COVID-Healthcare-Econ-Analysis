# Economic Analysis of Health Insurance Models and COVID-19

Here in this code, I'm looking at COVID data with regards to number of daily cases and deaths and examining how certain funding models and private/public methods of hospital functions may have brought those numbers out.

A related report done for the course Economic Analysis for Technologists can also be found. The introduction for that report can be found below. 

## Introduction

Healthcare refers to the area of providing health services such as preventative care, treatment of disease, and diagnosis to a population, usually with three main goals: keeping people healthy, treating the sick, and protecting families from financial ruin form medical bills. Healthcare is usually managed within the boundaries of a nation, and how the healthcare of that nation is defined is usually by how it structures the relationships between the hospitals, the insurers, the state, and the citizens. There are a number of different ways to manage these relationships, but generally four main systems have emerged: the Beveridge Model, the Bismarck Model, the National Health Insurance Model, and the Out-of-Pocket Model. The United States is a unique case, as it contains a patchwork of all four of these models.
